By Megiddo (Team Ulysses)

Installation:
Extract the uppl folder to garrysmod/addons

Insert limits into a config

Usage:

uppl_disabled <0/1> -- Enable/Disable Uppl on the fly.
uppl_affectadmins <0/1> -- Defaults to 1, set to 0 so admins aren't affected.

FAQs:
Q: Does the normal duplicator, Adv Dup, and Overload's Stacker support this?
A: The first two work out of the box with Uppl, but the Stacker STOOL needs some modification. See our thread for modification instructions.
